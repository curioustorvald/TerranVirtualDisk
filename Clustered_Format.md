# Virtual Block Filesystem

<aside>
üí° Comes with all the inconveniences of FAT!
</aside>

The filesystem is consisted of 4096 bytes blocks ‚Äî a number coincides with the cluster size of the modern ‚Äúhost‚Äù filesystem.

Everything will be a block ‚Äî the header, file allocation table, the actual file, etc.

Endianness: Big

# Blocks Overview

| Offset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Header |
| 1 | Bootsector |
| 2..3(7,15,31,63,‚Ä¶) | File Allocation Table |
| varies | File |

# Blocks

The Block ID is the block ‚Äúoffset‚Äù from the beginning of the archive.

An archive can have 16777216 blocks (max 64 GB)

## Header Block

1 Block size

### Structure

| Offset | Type       | Description |
| --- |------------| --- |
| 0 | **‚ÄúTEVd‚Äù**     | Magic |
| 4 | Uint48     | Disk size in bytes |
| 10 | Byte[32]   | Disk name |
| 42 | Int32      | CRC-32 |
| 46 | **0x11**       | Version |
| 47 | Byte       | Primary Attribute |
| 48 | Byte[16]   | User-defined Attributes |
| 64 | Uint32     | FAT size in blocks |
| 68 | Byte[4028] | Unused |
- Primary Attribute (1 byte)

## Bootsector Block

1 Block size, ‚Äúraw‚Äù formatted (has no structure, all 4096 bytes holds the actual data)

## File Allocation Table Block

16 entries per block with each entry is 256 bytes long

Block growing must be done in a way that (# of FAT + 2) is always power of 2

e.g. FAT count must be 2‚Üí6‚Üí14‚Üí30‚Üí62‚Üí126‚Üí254‚Üí‚Ä¶

### File Entry Structure

| Pointer to Block (3 bytes) | Flags (1 byte) | Filename (252 bytes) |
| --- | --- |----------------------|
- Flags
    - TODO
- Filename
    - 252 bytes, null-terminated except for the 252-char long name

## File Block

### Structure

| Meta (2 bytes) | Prev Ptr (3 bytes) | Next Ptr (3 bytes) | Contents (4088 bytes) |
| --- | --- | --- |-----------------------|

Ptr of 0 is used to mark NULL

- Meta bits

| Deleted? | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | Dirty? | Type ID (0..15) | Unused (8 bits) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |-----------------|

| Type ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Binary File |
| 1 | Directory |

### Directory File Contents
| entry size (2 bytes) | repetitoin: cluster numbers (3*n bytes) |
| --- |-----------------------------------------|

entry size cannot exceed 1362 (clusters that actually fits in the remaining bytes ‚Äî it the length of the directory is longer than that, extra entries must be specified on the next block of the file)

# Functions

## Disk Management Functions

### private renum(increment: Int)

Increments every number (block ptr) by given value.

### public defrag(option: Int = 0)

Removes gaps between blocks if `option` is 0.

OPTIONAL ‚Äî if `option` is 1, also makes the file blocks contiguous. Only beneficial if the host drive is rotational; SSDs will take no benefit and instead be worn down unnecessarily.

### public growFAT()

Grows the size of the FAT to the next notc.h. Renum must be called afterwards
